 Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language used to describe the content and structure of data in a document. It is a simplified version of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML). XML is an industry standard for delivering content on the Internet. Because it provides a facility to define new tags, XML is also extensible.
